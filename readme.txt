Elementor widgets for the Hello Event plugin

== Description ==

With the Hello Event plugin it is extremely easy to add event management and ticket sales to any WordPress site. The presentation of events on a Wordpress site is either controlled by the presentation template built into the Hello Event plugin, or by a theme template page created by a developer.

With this plugin it is easy for non-developers to set up the presentation of events directly with the Elementor editor. The plugin works perfectly with the free version of Elementor.


== Installation ==

Nothing special. Just like any other plugin. You need to have Elementor (free or pro version) and Hello Event installed and if you want to sell tickets you also need to have Woocommerce installed.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I don't use Elementor on my site, can I still use this plugin =

No. This plugin only works with Elementor. However, the Hello Event plugin provides many shortcodes that can be used on non-elementor pages. But doing this does not provide the same WYSIWYG experience as with Elementor.

= Where can I find more documentation? =

Documentation is available at the plugin page: (https://www.tekomatik.com/plugins/hello-event-widgets-for-elementor)

= Where can I find a demo site? =

A basic demo site that shows the Hello Event plugin in action is available here: <a href="https://hello.tekomatik.com" target="_blank">https://hello.tekomatik.com"</a>. On this site, events are either shown with the default presentation provided by Hello Events, or in some examples using Elementor and the Hello Events Elementor Widgets.
